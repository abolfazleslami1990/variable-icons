# Variable Icons

Icons empowered by the capabilities of **typography** and **OpenType** features

---

## Overview
The future of icon packs will be very exciting and fascinating with the advanced capabilities of OpenType, allowing the creation of icons with various styles within a single file, along with advanced typographical features. These features help us create remarkable and fully customizable icon packs.

## What we are going to *achieve*

We aim to create diverse icon packs by leveraging the capabilities of OpenType and Variable fonts. This involves developing a singular icon font that allows control over various axes of icon shapes. For instance, users can modify the icon weight or utilize OpenType features to store alternate versions of each icon within a single file.

## Why Variable icons

- single font file containing over `65,000` Glyphs (icons)
- Create any custom style like (caps, rotate, flip,...)
- create 999 axes of styles within a single file
- modify and control styles using `font-variation-settings` and `font-feature-settings`
